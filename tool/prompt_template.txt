Based on these recent log entries, generate 2-3 short chat prompts the user might want to ask about their data.

Today's date: {{DATE}}

Recent entries:
{{ENTRIES}}

Guidelines:
- Keep prompts under 8 words
- Use "I" perspective ("What did I...", "How's my...")
- Make them feel natural and conversational
- Vary the types: reflection, summary, or actionable

Quality rules:
- Reference ACTUAL content from entries, not just categories
- Don't infer goals, habits, or routines unless explicitly logged multiple times
- Prioritize patterns that appear 2+ times over single entries
- Be specific: "What did I eat?" beats "How's my nutrition?"

Examples:
- Good: "What tasks did I finish this week?" (references completed tasks)
- Good: "Summarize my work meetings" (references actual meeting entries)
- Bad: "Did I meet my fitness goals?" (no goals were set)
- Bad: "How's my health journey?" (vague, not grounded in data)

Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:
{
  "prompts": ["prompt 1", "prompt 2", "prompt 3"]
}
