# Test Coverage Improvement Plan - Behavioral Driven Development

## Overview
This plan focuses on improving test coverage using **Behavioral Driven Development (BDD)** approach, emphasizing user behaviors and business scenarios over unit testing. All tests will be written from a user perspective using Given-When-Then patterns.

## Current State
- ‚úÖ **Strong**: Widget tests for HomePage, dialogs, and user interactions (16 tests passing)
- ‚ùå **Gap**: No behavioral tests for core user workflows and business scenarios
- üéØ **Goal**: Comprehensive BDD coverage for all user journeys and business behaviors

---

## Phase 1: Core Entry Management Behaviors (High Priority)

### 1.1 Entry Lifecycle Behaviors
**File:** `test/behaviors/entry_management_behavior_test.dart`

**Scenarios to Cover:**
- **Creating entries through different methods**
  - Given user types text, When they submit, Then entry is categorized and saved
  - Given user records voice, When transcription completes, Then entry is created with correct category
  - Given user has existing text, When they start recording, Then text is preserved during voice input

- **Entry editing behaviors**
  - Given user has an entry, When they edit it, Then changes are saved and category is re-evaluated
  - Given user clears entry text, When they submit, Then edit mode is cancelled without saving
  - Given user is in edit mode, When they switch to voice input, Then edit context is maintained

- **Entry deletion and recovery**
  - Given user deletes an entry, When deletion completes, Then undo option is available
  - Given user deletes an entry, When they tap undo, Then entry is restored exactly as before
  - Given undo timer expires, When user tries to undo, Then undo is no longer available

### 1.2 AI Categorization Behaviors
**File:** `test/behaviors/ai_categorization_behavior_test.dart`

**Scenarios to Cover:**
- **Automatic categorization**
  - Given user enters work-related text, When AI processes it, Then entry is categorized as "Work"
  - Given user enters personal content, When AI processes it, Then entry is categorized as "Personal"
  - Given AI service is unavailable, When user creates entry, Then entry uses default category

- **Category learning**
  - Given user frequently uses custom categories, When AI categorizes new entries, Then it should prefer learned categories
  - Given user manually changes categories, When similar entries are created, Then AI should adapt

### 1.3 Data Persistence Behaviors
**File:** `test/behaviors/data_persistence_behavior_test.dart`

**Scenarios to Cover:**
- **App lifecycle persistence**
  - Given user has entries, When app is closed and reopened, Then all entries are preserved
  - Given user creates entry, When app crashes, Then entry is recovered on restart
  - Given user modifies categories, When app restarts, Then category changes persist

- **Data migration behaviors**
  - Given user has old data format, When app updates, Then data is migrated correctly
  - Given migration fails, When app starts, Then graceful fallback occurs

---

## Phase 2: Voice Input and Chat Behaviors (Medium Priority)

### 2.1 Voice Input User Journey
**File:** `test/behaviors/voice_input_behavior_test.dart`

**Scenarios to Cover:**
- **Recording session behaviors**
  - Given user taps mic button, When recording starts, Then UI shows recording state
  - Given user is recording, When they tap stop, Then transcription begins
  - Given recording is too short, When user stops, Then appropriate feedback is shown

- **Permission handling**
  - Given microphone permission denied, When user taps mic, Then permission request is shown
  - Given permission is granted, When user taps mic, Then recording starts immediately
  - Given permission is revoked during recording, When recording stops, Then graceful error handling

- **Transcription accuracy**
  - Given user speaks clearly, When transcription completes, Then text accurately reflects speech
  - Given background noise exists, When transcription runs, Then system handles noise appropriately
  - Given transcription fails, When error occurs, Then user receives clear feedback

### 2.2 Chat System Behaviors
**File:** `test/behaviors/chat_behavior_test.dart`

**Scenarios to Cover:**
- **Conversation flow**
  - Given user opens chat, When they ask about entries, Then AI provides relevant information
  - Given user asks follow-up questions, When AI responds, Then context is maintained
  - Given user references specific entries, When AI searches, Then correct entries are found

- **Chat error handling**
  - Given AI service is down, When user sends message, Then appropriate error message is shown
  - Given network is unavailable, When user chats, Then offline message is displayed
  - Given API rate limit hit, When user sends message, Then rate limit handling occurs

---

## Phase 3: User Onboarding and Category Management (Lower Priority)

### 3.1 First-Time User Experience
**File:** `test/behaviors/onboarding_behavior_test.dart`

**Scenarios to Cover:**
- **Initial setup flow**
  - Given new user opens app, When onboarding starts, Then guided setup is presented
  - Given user completes setup, When they create first entry, Then appropriate help is shown
  - Given user skips onboarding, When they use features, Then contextual help is available

- **Category setup**
  - Given user is setting up categories, When they add custom category, Then it's available for use
  - Given user has work-related needs, When they choose work categories, Then appropriate templates are provided

### 3.2 Category Management Behaviors
**File:** `test/behaviors/category_management_behavior_test.dart`

**Scenarios to Cover:**
- **Category lifecycle**
  - Given user creates new category, When they save it, Then it's available for entry classification
  - Given user edits category, When changes are saved, Then existing entries update appropriately
  - Given user deletes category, When deletion occurs, Then affected entries are handled gracefully

- **Category filtering**
  - Given user has multiple categories, When they filter by category, Then only relevant entries show
  - Given user clears filters, When filter is removed, Then all entries are visible again

---

## Phase 4: Advanced User Scenarios and Edge Cases

### 4.1 Multi-Modal Input Behaviors
**File:** `test/behaviors/multi_modal_input_behavior_test.dart`

**Scenarios to Cover:**
- **Combined input methods**
  - Given user types partial text, When they add voice input, Then both inputs are combined
  - Given user is in edit mode, When they use voice, Then voice content replaces selected text
  - Given user switches between input modes, When they submit, Then final result includes all inputs

### 4.2 Performance and Reliability Behaviors
**File:** `test/behaviors/app_reliability_behavior_test.dart`

**Scenarios to Cover:**
- **Background operations**
  - Given user creates many entries, When vector store syncs, Then app remains responsive
  - Given sync is in progress, When user creates new entry, Then entry is queued appropriately
  - Given app is backgrounded, When user returns, Then all data is current

- **Network resilience**
  - Given network is intermittent, When user performs actions, Then app handles connectivity gracefully
  - Given user is offline, When they create entries, Then entries are queued for later sync
  - Given connection returns, When sync resumes, Then all queued data is processed

---

## Phase 5: Integration and End-to-End User Journeys

### 5.1 Complete User Workflows
**File:** `test/behaviors/complete_user_journeys_test.dart`

**Scenarios to Cover:**
- **Daily usage patterns**
  - Given user starts their day, When they log activities throughout day, Then entries capture their journey
  - Given user wants to review their week, When they browse entries, Then they can find and reflect on activities
  - Given user searches for specific memories, When they use chat, Then relevant entries are surfaced

- **Power user scenarios**
  - Given user manages complex categories, When they bulk edit entries, Then changes are applied correctly
  - Given user exports their data, When export completes, Then data is in expected format
  - Given user imports old data, When import runs, Then existing data is preserved

## Implementation Guidelines

### BDD Test Structure
```dart
group('User creates entry through text input', () {
  testWidgets('Given user has app open, When they type and submit text, Then entry is created and categorized', 
    (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Given - Set up initial state
    await givenUserHasAppOpen(tester);
    
    // When - Perform user action
    await whenUserTypesText(tester, 'Had a great meeting with the team');
    await whenUserSubmitsEntry(tester);
    
    // Then - Verify expected outcome
    await thenEntryIsCreated(tester, 'Had a great meeting with the team');
    await thenEntryIsCategorized(tester, 'Work');
    await thenEntryAppearsInList(tester);
  });
});
```

### Test Focus Areas
