# Feature Specification: Unified Text Field with Chat Intent Detection

**Feature Branch**: `001-chat-feature-i`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "chat feature i want to add to the app. i want the user to be able to start a chat by typing in the unified text field. this text field is multi-putpose. right now it is sused to log notes. now we will be etending it so users can also chat with their notes. we will be using a small ai model to determine if the message is a note or a chat. if its a chat, i want it to start a new chat in a full screen. the user can ask questions about their logs and the ai will search through the users logs to answers questions."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: When AI intent detection fails or is unavailable, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Default to note-logging mode (fail-safe to existing functionality)
- Q: When the AI cannot find relevant logs to answer a chat question, what should the user see? ‚Üí A: AI responds dynamically with a chat message (no predefined error message)
- Q: Should chat sessions persist across app restarts? ‚Üí A: No - each chat session is fresh and independent (no persistence across restarts)
- Q: Should the full-screen chat preserve and display the original query text that triggered it? ‚Üí A: Yes - show the original query as the first message in chat
- Q: When intent detection determines the input is ambiguous (could be either note or chat), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Ask user to clarify with a UI prompt (manual selection)
- Q: How should the system handle intent detection latency - should text submission be blocked until AI classification completes? ‚Üí A: Block submission until classification completes (user waits for AI)
- Q: Should users be able to manually override intent detection (force a message to be note or chat)? ‚Üí A: No - always rely on AI classification (simpler UX)
- Q: What specific visual feedback should be shown during intent detection processing? ‚Üí A: Loading state is already built into the input field (reuse existing loading indicator)
- Q: Are there specific keywords that should always trigger chat mode? ‚Üí A: No - leave intent classification entirely up to the AI model's determination
- Q: Is there a character limit for the unified text field? ‚Üí A: Yes - 2000 characters maximum
- Q: What happens if user's log history is empty when they try to chat? ‚Üí A: User can still chat normally; AI will respond but won't have logs to reference
- Q: Should users see which specific logs contributed to each answer? ‚Üí A: No - AI provides answers without explicit log attribution in the UI

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story
A user opens the app and sees a unified text input field at the bottom of the screen. They can type text into this field for two purposes:

1. **Logging a note**: The user types a personal log entry (e.g., "Had coffee with Sarah today") and the system saves it as a categorized log entry.
2. **Starting a chat**: The user types a question about their logs (e.g., "When was the last time I had coffee?") and the system recognizes this as a chat intent, then opens a full-screen chat interface where the AI searches through the user's logs to answer the question.

The system automatically determines whether the user wants to log a note or start a chat based on the content they type. When chat intent is detected, the transition to the full-screen chat happens seamlessly, and the user can continue asking follow-up questions about their logged data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is on the main screen with the unified text field visible, **When** they type "Had lunch at Thai restaurant" and submit, **Then** the system saves this as a new log entry with appropriate categorization.

2. **Given** the user is on the main screen with the unified text field visible, **When** they type "What restaurants have I been to this month?" and submit, **Then** the system detects chat intent, transitions to a full-screen chat interface, and displays an AI-generated answer based on searching the user's logs.

3. **Given** the user has started a chat session via the unified text field, **When** they ask follow-up questions in the full-screen chat interface, **Then** the AI continues to search and respond based on the user's log history.

4. **Given** the user is in the full-screen chat interface, **When** they close or exit the chat, **Then** they return to the main screen with the unified text field ready for new input.

5. **Given** the user types text into the unified text field, **When** the intent detection is ambiguous, **Then** the system prompts the user with a UI to manually select between note-logging or chat mode.

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- When the AI intent detection model is unavailable or fails, the system defaults to note-logging mode to preserve core functionality.
- When the user types an empty message or only whitespace, the submit button remains disabled (no action taken).
- When the AI cannot find relevant information in the user's logs to answer a chat question, it responds with a dynamically generated chat message (no predefined error template).
- User submission is blocked until intent classification completes. During this time, the existing input field loading state provides visual feedback.
- Users cannot manually override AI intent classification - the system always relies on AI determination (or prompts for clarification when ambiguous).
- Text input is limited to 2000 characters maximum. If user reaches the limit, input is truncated or submission is prevented.
- If the user's log history is empty and they try to start a chat, the chat still opens normally. The AI will respond to questions but won't have any logs to reference in its answers.
- If the vector store search times out or fails during a chat query, the AI responds with a chat message indicating it couldn't access the logs at this time.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept text input from a unified text field that serves both note logging and chat initiation purposes.
- **FR-002**: System MUST use an AI model to automatically classify user input as either "note" or "chat" intent.
- **FR-003**: System MUST save user input as a categorized log entry when "note" intent is detected.
- **FR-004**: System MUST transition to a full-screen chat interface when "chat" intent is detected.
- **FR-005**: System MUST search through the user's existing logs to answer questions when in chat mode.
- **FR-006**: System MUST display AI-generated responses in the full-screen chat interface based on log search results.
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to ask follow-up questions within the chat session.
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to exit the full-screen chat interface and return to the main screen.
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve the unified text field's existing note-logging functionality without breaking changes.
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide visual feedback during intent detection processing by displaying the existing input field loading state and disabling the input field.
- **FR-011**: System MUST prompt user with a manual selection UI when intent detection determines input is ambiguous. When intent detection service is unavailable or fails, system defaults to note-logging mode.
- **FR-012**: System MUST respond with a dynamically generated AI chat message when no relevant logs are found for a query.
- **FR-013**: System MUST create fresh, independent chat sessions (no persistence across app restarts).
- **FR-014**: Users MUST NOT be able to manually override AI intent classification - system relies solely on AI determination or user clarification when ambiguous.
- **FR-015**: System MUST block user submission until intent classification completes and provide visual feedback during processing.
- **FR-016**: System MUST rely entirely on AI model determination for intent classification without using predefined keywords or query patterns.
- **FR-017**: System MUST display the original query text as the first message when the full-screen chat opens.

### Key Entities
- **Text Input Message**: Represents the raw text entered by the user in the unified field (maximum 2000 characters), containing the content and timestamp of submission.
- **Intent Classification**: Represents the AI's determination of whether a text input is a "note" or "chat". When classification is ambiguous, the user is prompted to manually select the intended mode.
- **Chat Session**: Represents a continuous conversation between the user and the AI, containing the sequence of questions and responses within the full-screen interface. Each session is fresh and independent with no persistence across app restarts. The original triggering query is displayed as the first message.
- **Chat Query**: Represents a user's question asked during a chat session, including the original text and any context needed for log search.
- **Chat Response**: Represents the AI-generated answer to a chat query, including the answer text. Log attribution is not displayed to users.
